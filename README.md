# Google Messages Desktop

👋 Welcome to Google Messages Desktop! This is an unofficial Electron-based wrapper for Google Messages, bringing the web app to your desktop with some extra goodies. It's optimized for M1 Macs, but we're open to expanding support - just open an issue if you need it for a different system!

- 🍎 Looks great on Retina displays (especially on M1 Macs!)
- 🚀 Fast startup and low resource usage
